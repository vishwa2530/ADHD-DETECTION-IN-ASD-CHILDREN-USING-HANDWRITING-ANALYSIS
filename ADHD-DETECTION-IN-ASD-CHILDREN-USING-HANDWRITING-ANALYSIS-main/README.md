# ADHD-DETECTION-IN-ASD-CHILDREN-USING-HANDWRITING-ANALYSIS
This study proposes a machine learning-based approach to detect ADHD in children with ASD through handwriting analysis. Using features like tremors, pen pressure, and stroke velocity, models such as SVM, RF, and CNN are evaluated. Results show promising accuracy, aiding in early, non-invasive diagnosis and personalized care.
# üß† Advanced ADHD Detection from Handwriting Samples using Deep Learning

A robust, GPU-powered deep learning system designed to detect **ADHD**, **ASD** in children by analyzing handwriting samples. This project leverages **ResNet50V2** with custom CNN layers and was inspired by the need for early, accessible, and non-invasive ADHD diagnosis support‚Äîespecially for children with **Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)**.

## üìñ Background

ADHD is one of the most common neurodevelopmental disorders in children. Detecting ADHD early is critical, especially among children with ASD, where overlapping symptoms can make diagnosis more challenging. This project explores an ML-based solution that uses handwriting patterns to distinguish ADHD, ASD, and control conditions.

## üß∞ System Architecture
  overview: >
    The system takes a scanned handwriting sample as input and processes it through
    several stages including preprocessing, feature extraction using ResNet50V2, and
    classification via a custom CNN head. The final diagnosis is then displayed via a
    simple user interface.

  components:
    - name: "Web UI"
      function: "Allows users to upload handwriting images (PNG, JPG)"
    - name: "Preprocessing Module"
      function: "Resizes image, converts to grayscale, normalizes pixel values"
    - name: "Feature Extractor"
      function: "Uses ResNet50V2 (include_top=False) to extract spatial features"
    - name: "Classification Head"
      function: >
        Custom CNN head with dense layers and dropout that predicts 
        one of three classes: ADHD, ASD, or Control
    - name: "Output Module"
      function: "Displays predicted class to user with optional confidence scores"
