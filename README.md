# ADHD-DETECTION-IN-ASD-CHILDREN-USING-HANDWRITING-ANALYSIS

This study proposes a machine learning-based approach to detect ADHD in children with ASD through handwriting analysis. Using features like tremors, pen pressure, and stroke velocity, models such as SVM, RF, and CNN are evaluated. Results show promising accuracy, aiding in early, non-invasive diagnosis and personalized care.

#Advanced ADHD Detection from Handwriting Samples using Deep Learning

A robust, GPU-powered deep learning system designed to detect ADHD, ASD in children by analyzing handwriting samples. This project leverages ResNet50V2 with custom CNN layers and was inspired by the need for early, accessible, and non-invasive ADHD diagnosis supportâ€”especially for children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD).
